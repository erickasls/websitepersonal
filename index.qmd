Ericka Salas-Garcia is a first-generation, Mexican-American, and a graduate from UT Austin. She started her Freshmen year at UT with an interest in Healthcare by pursuing a degree in Biology with the goal of pursuing Medical School. She became a part of the FRI (Freshmen Research Initiative) program at UT Austin, and joined the Big Data in Biology research group. It became a turning point for her after her experience as a Bioinformatics Undergraduate Researcher with Dell Medical School - she instantly switched to pursue technology. She landed a Data Engineer internship the Summer of 2021. Then post-grad she decided to give Solution Engineering a try at Oracle. When not innovating on depths of technical solutions, Ericka enjoys spending time with Family, Friends and playing with her dog Milo.
